Indiano James and The Lost Treasure

The player encounters a completely random maze every time a game begins, and cannot see where the exit is; so the only way is to look for the treasure; the only box that shines like gold. To fight the enemies you will need the magic weapons that are scattered throughout the dungeon, which shine in a strange and mysterious green color. Lastly, and most importantly, you have neglected breakfast at home before you leave, so every time you move, you will lose energy ... Eating the orange mushrooms found on the walls of the dungeon is your salvation.
